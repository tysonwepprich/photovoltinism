Sketch of workflow

- Run (GCA/APHA/DCA)_tyson.R for one year's PRISM data, takes about an hour for CONUS
  - Adjust substages, region, year, photoperiod (although this is fast to redo)
- Rerun model photoperiod responses without redoing all daily GDD iterations (update_photoperiod.R)
- Add sims (discrete substage sizes) together for weighted rasters for plotting (modelPlots.R)
- Mosaic maps together if CONUS (modelPlots.R), only for weighted rasters because this takes a while
